ToDo's:
- Manual: Generate a certificate

./getcert.sh

- Use certificate (from file system as of now) to register Event Definition
- Add Simple Hook and push event using certificate
- Manual Create basic auth user and add it to registration
- Try to call API using a lambda function
- Add Swagger plugin and register API

Future Functionality:
- Replace basic auth with oAuth (maybe write custom OAuth provider)
- Add event hooks via UI
- Think about JWT Token Authentication

Swagger API Definition:
https://github.com/starfishmod/WPAPI-SwaggerGenerator

Event Hooks: https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/

Basic Auth Plugin: 
- Create new User


TODO:
- Cleanup and Enhanced error handling
- Make Event Handling more generic
